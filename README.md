# Game-Portfolio
Look at this repository for my game design portfolio.

All of these files are snippets of code from games that I have made in Game Maker: Studio. The code is based on C++.
I don't want to upload all of the code becuse it will take to long and I don't want to reveal all of the code to the public.
